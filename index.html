            Türkiye is a large peninsula that bridges the continents of Europe and Asia. türkiye is surrounded on three
            sides
            by the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Aegean Sea. Istanbul, the largest city in türkiye, is built
            on
            land in the Bosporus seaway. The city is partly in Europe and partly in Asia.
            türkiye's highest mountain, Mount Ararat has two peaks, with Great Ararat reaching 16,945 feet (5,165
            meters).
            The mountain is considered sacred by many people and is believed to be where Noah beached his ark after the
            great flood.
            Turks are family oriented and are very hospitable people. They invite visitors to their homes and make sure
            they
            have something to eat and drink before they leave.

          <h3>Beautiful Türkiye</h3>
          <p>
            Türkiye is a resting location for birds on their migratory journey between their summer and winter homes.
            They
            flock to Kus Golu, or Bird Lake in a protected national forest that is surrounded by reed marshes. The first
            national park in türkiye opened in 1958.

            Today there are 39 parks where rare species and their habitats are protected. Several species are at risk,
            including the northern bald eagle which is critically endangered.

            At one time, türkiye was home to jackals, lynx, wolves, and bears but those animal species are rare now. The
            Turkish horned viper snake has spikelike scales that poke upward near their eyes.

            Once known as Cotton Castle, the white cliffs in Pamukkale in western türkiye are made of a calcium-rich
            mineral
            called travertine. The cliffs look like a sheet of ice covering a hillside from a distance. A spring flows
            from
            pool to pool. The cascade is 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers) long.
